# Learn a New Language Using Data Science

If we ever think about [frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis), it is usually in the context of cryptography, in which it is used to break classical ciphers. In written language, patterns regularly appear, notably in the building blocks of words. Or saying it another way, the repition of certain letters of the alphabet.

As an aside, you may notice from the graph that you could derive the fanciful phrase [ETAOIN SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu), which illustrates the 12 most frequent letters in English writing.

We may also apply the distribution of occurence to other forms of language study, which leads us to the premise for this article and related project. Using the concepts from [Learning languages very quickly — with the help of some very basic Data Science](https://hackernoon.com/learning-languages-very-quickly-with-the-help-of-some-very-basic-data-science-cdbf95288333), by @adatlaborhu we may be able to learn Spanish.
